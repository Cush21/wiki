## Training Overview 
Training for Swarf XL has two phases: 
- CAD / CAM training, which is computer-based and covers the process to the point where a G-code file for use on the machine has been produced 
- Machine Operation, which is conducted hands-on with the machine. During this phase of the training the file produced in CAD / CAM Training is used to make a part.

CAD stands for Computer Aided Design. In the context of using the machine, CAD involves generating a digital representation of the thing you want to make. You may be able to make things from CAD models you have downloaded but we teach the very basics anyway.

CAM stands for Computer Aided Manufacturing. In this context, CAM involves generating instructions from a CAD model that tell the machine how to make it. Since those instructions are particular to the machine, materials, cutting tools available and of course what you want to make, it is generally not possible to bypass the CAM step and just download something from the internet.

We teach two different CAD / CAM tools and workflows. Feel free to choose the one that best suits your needs: 
- Aspire, a product of Vectric, is an excellent and easy to use 2d design program with good native CAM support for laser cutters and CNC routers. It is not free, but the Artifactory has a full Aspire license and the program can import vector files in a wide range of formats. Aspire suits CNC router users who want to make relatively simple parts (profiles cut out of sheet material for example) with limited time spent learning new software.
- Fusion (formerly Fusion 360) is a product of Autodesk. Fusion is a very flexible and powerful 3D CAD / CAM application with a deep feature set and a mountain of on-line instructional content. There is a "Personal Use" version that is free and highly capable. Fusion suits users who want to make 3-dimensional parts, learn a more powerful design tool, and/or go beyond the basics of CNC machining. However it requires a larger investment of the user's time.   

If you have relevant prior experience, you are free to skip CAD / CAM training. The trainer will take a look at your work as part of Machine Operation training (as they would do for any trainee) and ensure it is OK to use on the machine.
