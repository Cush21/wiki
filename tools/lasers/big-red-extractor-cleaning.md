# Big Red - Extractor Cleaning

Big Red uses an extractor fan to pull smoke and fumes out of the laser cutter.

This extractor fan is located in the machine room.

The fan clogs over time, reducing its suction power.

> Obtain approval from the Lasers Subcommittee (via #lasers on Slack) before performing this task.

To clean the fan,

1. Tag Big Red "Out of service".
2. Disconnect the fan and take it outside.
3. Dismantle the fan and clean it as per the photos below.
4. Return everything to service and test that suction is working.
