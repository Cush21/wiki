-   cutting things with lasers

## Skills

Predominantly software: Java, Android, Rails, distributed systems. Background in Mechanical Engineering

## Things Done

-   3D recreation - Proof of concept in stitching multiple 2D photos together to create a 3D model, then manipulate and run through the 3D printer
-   [Gearbug1](/projects/gearbug1) - first laser project, plans from [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31426)
-   [frabjous](/projects/frabjous) - assemblage of 30 identical pieces cut from a [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:724) model.

## Things Doing

-   [Compressed Air Engine](/projects/airengine) - engine run on compressed air
-   Stepper power - power generation, storage and distribution based on stepper motors.
-   NFC Scavenger - covert scavenger hunt style game by finding and scanning NFC tags then using hints to find the next tag.
