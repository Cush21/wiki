If you have an item in the courtyard that requires watering please put the schedule in here so that the timer can be kept accurate!

Kai/Danielle - Greenhouse (triangluar one) needs 8 min of watering at 7am and 9pm.

[](/user/factotum) - Garden Beds - A short water twice a day (whatever the green house gets is fine - it's on the same pipe run!)
