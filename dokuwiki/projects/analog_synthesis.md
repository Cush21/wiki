### Analog Synthesis Hardware projects at the Artifactory

First up is a PaIA Fatman, an analog synthesizer that includes a MIDI-CV converter, so bridging the analog and digital worlds

PaIA Fatman to be optionally partly controlled by a PaIA Theremax theremin via CV out.

Also in progress - a XoXBox, a TB303 clone sequenced analog synth.

Hopefully, these will be the first of several.
