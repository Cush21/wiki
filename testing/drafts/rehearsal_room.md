# Rehearsal room by-laws

These are the [by-laws](/docs/policies/bylaws) governing use of the rehearsal room.

By-laws are made by the committee, as allowed for rule 65 of the [Constitution](/constitution) regarding *By-laws*.

## Background (informative)

The rehearsal room is a shared rehearsal space, mainly used by bands with band membership.

See (Areas - Rehearsal Room) for more information on the equipment available in the rehearsal room.

## Objects of this by-law

To define the rehearsal room booking process.
To balance use of the rehearsal room against other uses of the space.

## Terms used

* "We" or "us" means the Association, committee members, and any officer or subcommittee member authorised to act on behalf of the committee.
* "Informative" means a part of this document that is for information only.

## Bookings

The rehearsal room is booked in sessions of up to 4 hours duration.

> Ed: This was previously defined as "Generally a morning, an afternoon, or an evening."

Bookings for the rehearsal room must be made at least 48 hours in advance.

Bookings are made in a shared calendar.

> (Informative)

## Rehearsal Room usage fees

Refer to [Fees](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/fees).


## Noise restrictions

Use of the rehearsal room may be restricted during events which require background noise to be limited.

Such events will be marked in the booking calendar as either -

* Quiet bands only.



> (Informative)
>
> There is a [publicly viewable calendar](https://space.artifactory.org.au/bands.html) that shows both a) rehearsal room bookings and b) events occuring in the space. This calendar can be used to coordinate band room bookings and how they interact with other scheduled events.
{.is-info}

A "quiet band" is broadly defined as:

* No acoustic drum kits.
* A maximum of two guitars / amps.
* A willingness to turn the volume down if requested.
