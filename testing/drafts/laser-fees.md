# DRAFT - Laser Cutting Fees

If you only need to use the laser cutters for one job, the easiest way may be to ask one of our volunteers to set up and cut the job for you.

The fee for this service is -

* Day Pass Rate + operator time @ $5.00 per 10 minutes, rounded up to the nearest $5.
* Operator time includes both -
  * The time that the operator spends setting up your job, and
  * The time that the machine spends cutting your job, which the operator must supervise at all times.

This fee does not include the supply of material.
- Only certain types of material are compatible with the laser cutters - check the [laser materials](/tools/lasers/materials) page or ask us beforehand.
- Some materials may be available to purchase on the day - ask us beforehand.
