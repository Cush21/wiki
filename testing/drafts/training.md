About training
Some of our tools are hazardous or easy to damage if used incorrectly.
We classify our tools into three levels.
Low risk 🌶
You need to self-assess your competency to use these tools. There’s no formal training requirement for them.
We put green markings on these tools. 🟢
If you’re not sure how to use a 🟢 tool, please ask – we’re happy to help!
Medium risk 🌶️🌶️
These tools can easily hurt you or others.
We mark these tools with yellow signs or yellow markings. 🟡
These tools require a competency check to use.
If you don’t know how to use a 🟡 tool yet, or you’re not 100% confident, please let us know! We’ll be happy to train you.
If we notice you using a tool incorrectly, we’ll ask you to pause your job and change what you’re doing.
Any authorized trainer who is competent with a medium risk tool can deliver training for that tool.
High risk 🌶️🌶️🌶️
These tools can cause serious injury, or are easy to damage, or both.
We mark these high risk tools with red signs or red markings. 🔴


You must go through the Artifactory’s training on high risk 🔴 tools, even if you have used similar tools elsewhere.
Only specific people can deliver training for high risk 🔴 tools.
There is an Authorized Operator List for each high risk 🔴 tool. You must be on the list to use the tool.
Requesting training 
You can request training in the #training-and-inductions channel on Slack.
•	Some training is only available by booking a time in advance.
