### Band Membership

Description: The Artifactory Rehearsal Room is a shared rehearsal space, used by bands with band membership of the Perth Artifactory. Use of Artifactory tools/equipment etc is encouraged, but charged at the day pass rates.

> Some thinking needed here.
> * Eligibility criteria - do all members of the band need to be over 18?
> * Use of workshop ("use of artifactory tools is encouraged...") - does this include after hours (since they hold a 24/7 key)? Does it include the entire band (with the band's keyholder discharging the keyholder responsibilities?) or just the band member who is the keyholder?
> Ren: Reword "charged at day pass rates" to clarify what this means. I think Tool use should just be excluded from the class of membership as the entity is the band, not the multiple individuals.
> Ren: 24/7 access limited to rehearsal slots only?
