### Band Membership

Description: The Artifactory Rehearsal Room is a shared rehearsal space, used by bands with band membership of the Perth Artifactory. Use of Artifactory tools/equipment etc is encouraged, but charged at the day pass rates.

> Some thinking needed here.
> * Eligibility criteria - do all members of the band need to be over 18?
> * Use of workshop ("use of artifactory tools is encouraged...") - does this include after hours (since they hold a 24/7 key)? Does it include the entire band (with the band's keyholder discharging the keyholder responsibilities?) or just the band member who is the keyholder?

> Move all rehearsal room stuff out to a separate page?
>
> Combine:
>
> - Casual use of the rehearsal room
> - Band membership use of rehearsal room
> - Resident artist entitlements to rehearsal room
> - Event specific noise restrictions

* Band membership entitles each band to the following:
  * 3 rehearsal slots/month;
  * Extra bookings may be made if a slot is free, no earlier than 48 hours in advance of the time you are booking
  * Free entry for band members to NoizeMaschin!! and the ModularSynth building nights
  * A rehearsal slot is considered (broadly) to be a morning, afternoon or evening.
  * The band members are part of the wider Artifactory community, and are encouraged to be part of that community and work with the others to help make the space usable for everyone.
* Band membership restrictions. The following times have restrictions on the use of the room due to other Artifactory events at which use of the rehearsal room interferes due to sound spill. There may also be others on a one-off basis that will be communicated to the bands when known.
  * 3rd Tuesday(usually) evening of each month – quiet\* bands only (ADUG Monthly Meeting)
  * 4th/Last Tuesday(usually) evening of each month – no rehearsals permitted (NoizeMaschin!!)
  * Wednesday evenings – quiet* bands only

\* Quiet Bands are defined as not including an acoustic drum kit, a maximum of 2 guitars/amps, and a willingness to turn the volume down if requested. Again, please make yourselves known to any others using the Artifactory while you are rehearsing to make this a comfortable conversation if required.


## Classes of associate membership
