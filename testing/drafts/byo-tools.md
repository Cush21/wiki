The Artifactory has a [wide selection of tools](/tools) which cover the majority of member needs.

This policy applies when a member wants to bring in their own tools ("BYO tools") to use at the space.

## Tool categories

Low Risk 游릭, Medium Risk 游리, and High Risk 游댮 are defined in the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy.

## Casual / Day Pass users

Casual / Day Pass users are not allowed to BYO tools.

## Low Risk tools 游릭

* Members can BYO tools that we classify (or would classify) as Low Risk 游릭 tools.
* If a member is not 100% certain that their tool is Low Risk 游릭, they should seek advice from a member of the [Management Committee](/docs/committee/home) or the [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2).
* Mains-powered tools must have been tested and tagged within the last 6 months.

## Medium Risk 游리 and High Risk 游댮 tools

* For a member to BYO a Medium Risk 游리 or High Risk 游댮 tool of a type covered by an [Artifactory tool induction](/docs/policies/training), the member must be an Artifactory authorised operator for that same type of tool.
* The member must justify why the tool needs to be BYO instead of using the equivalent Artifactory tool.
  * This justification can be approved by an trainer authorised to train on the relevant tool in question.
* Tools that we would classify as a Medium or High Risk tool, but which are **not** covered by an Artifactory tool induction, cannot be used without approval from a member of the [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2).
* Mains-powered tools must have been tested and tagged within the last 6 months.
