The Artifactory cannot exist without the support of our community and donations are a big part of that support. We appreciate all donations of material, equipment, and funds put towards supporting our aims. In recognition of the impact we have on the community the Australian Tax Office has endorsed us[^1] as a Deductible Gift Recipient. This means that gifts you give to The Artifactory after **August 29th 2023** may be tax deductible.

## What is tax deductible?

Gifts are things you give to the Artifactory with no expectation of getting anything personally in return.

Tax deductible items include[^2]:

* Monetary donations for buying equipment and improving infrastructure in the space (Primarily through [PledgeBot](slack://app?team=T0LQE2JNR&id=A02KPH5PJUE) where indicated)
* Monetary support towards [sponsored membership funds](https://artifactory.org.au/free_membership) (provided you are not a recipient of one of these funds)
* Monetary donations where no set purpose has been outlined
* Donations of equipment and material that were purchased within the last 12 months
* Donations of equipment and material currently valued at over $5,000

Things that benefit you personally are not gifts, and are not tax deductible, including:

* Membership fees
* Event admission fees
* Tool usage fees
* Things you buy while in the space, e.g. food and drinks, supplies for making things

## Who can authorise a donation of equipment or material

Any member of the [Management Committee](/docs/committee/home#committee-members or [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2) may accept donations on our behalf. Please do not purchase items with the express intent of gifting them before talking to us first. 

## How do I claim a tax deduction?

Our treasurers will make sure that you get an invoice or receipt for any tax deductible gifts you give to the Artifactory.

This process is automatic for donations made through PledgeBot but may need to be [manually initiated](mailto:treasurer@artifactory.org.au) for other donations.

For donations of equipment exceeding $5,000 we will supply you with the appropriate certificate of donation.[^3]

You can use these documents as evidence when claiming tax deductions on your tax return.
