# New members guide

Welcome to the Perth Artifactory. We look forwards to helping you meet people and make stuff!

Please take a few minutes to read this guide, which summarises the most important things you need to know.

## Official stuff

We are legally required to record every member's full name and address in our register of members. 

* Please take a moment to [confirm your details](https://artifactory.tidyhq.com/member/profile/edit) (name, address, and contact information) in TidyHQ.
* We strongly recommend that you also enter details of an emergency contact in TidyHQ.

The [Constitution of the Perth Artifactory](/constitution) specifies your basic rights and responsibilities as a member, amongst other things.

Our [Code of conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) applies to every participant in the Artifactory.

Our [by-laws](/committeerulings) (committee rulings) cover things such as -

* [Classes of membership](/docs/policies/classes_of_membership) - what is included (or excluded) from your class of membership.
* [Fees](/docs/policies/fees) - including tool usage fees for specific tools.
* [Storage](/docs/policies/storage) - storing your property in the space.
* [Minors in the space](/docs/policies/bylaws).
* [24/7 access and RFID keys](/docs/policies/bylaws).

The Artifactory is run by an elected volunteer [committee](/docs/committee/home).
* You can contact the committee by emailing committee@artifactory.org.au.

Webcams

You can also request to be issued an RFID key for 24/7 access to the space.

Making restrictions.

## Tools and training

Some of our equipment is especially dangerous or easily damaged. Using this equipment improperly could easily cause death, severe injury, or significant property damage.

You must be trained, deemed competent, and authorised before using certain items of equipment in the space.

Training is provided by volunteers as their time permits.

You can request training on these tools via Slack:

* Laser cutters - request training via the #lasers channel.
* Machine tools (turret mill, metal lathe, CNC routers, drill press **(??)**, band saws **(??)** ) - request training via the #tools-and-fabrication channel.
* Woodworking equipment **(??)** (wood lathe, table saw) - request training via the #tools-and-fabrication channel

## Storage space

## Communal materials

## Housekeeping

Please keep the space safe and pleasant for everyone.

* **Pick up your rubbish.**
* **Leave the space cleaner than you found it.**
* Wipe, sweep, or vacuum your area after use.
* Put away the stuff you used.
* Vacuums, dustpans, and brooms are available in abundance.

## Safety

We are designated as a factory space.

* Ensure access areas are kept clean, tools are safe

> ^ What does this mean?

* Wear appropriate clothing and footwear.
* Use personal protective equipment, such as eye protection and hearing protection, appropriate to what you are doing.

When doing things in the space, always consider -

1. What am I about to do?
2. How could it go wrong?
3. How can I stop it from going wrong?

If you are working alone, consider what would happen if something went wrong. Consider deferring risky tasks or use of heavy tools to a time when other people will be around to help.

To protect our electronics, furniture, and people's breathing ---

* Only use powered woodworking tools and spray paints in approved areas.
* Resins and other volatiles should not be used inside.

To avoid cross-contamination between food and projects ---

* Don't work on projects on the social table.
* The bar/kitchen area (and the sink in the kitchen area) is for food and hygiene purposes only.

Take note of our policies regarding [dangerous projects and tools](/docs/committee/dangerous_projects_and_tools_policy).

Report incidents and near misses.

* Use the [incident reporting form](https://cloud.artifactory.org.au/apps/forms/62rTWpZH4fr5di2H) to record the details while they are fresh in your mind.
* Our goal is to address the causes of incidents, to prevent them happening again.



## Paying your membership fees

Membership fees are payable for each period (monthly or annually) in advance.

We will send invoices for membership fees to you by email.

* The invoice emails will come from tidyhq.com.
* Some email filters classify emails from TidyHQ as spam - please whitelist `tidyhq.com`.

There are two ways you can pay your invoices ---

1. **Preferred** - By direct deposit to our [bank account](/docs/committee/bank_details).
  * We pay less fees when you pay by direct deposit!
  * You can set up a scheduled bank transfer so you never forget.
  * Reciepts are sent within two weeks of payment. 

2. Via TidyHQ, by pressing the "Pay Now" button on the invoice.

Once your payment is processed, you will see your monthly membership status in TidyHQ change from "Partial" to "Active".

## Cancelling, suspending, or altering your membership

You can **cancel** your membership by contacting both the secretary (secretary@artifactory.org.au) and the treasurer (treasurer@artifactory.org.au).

If you wish to **suspend** your membership ---

* This is effectively the same as resigning your membership and re-joining at a later stage.
* Please contact the treasurer (treasurer@artifactory.org.au) **in advance of** the date when you want to suspend your membership.
* Please collect your property from the Artifactory. *(Un-collected property will be dealt with as per our [storage by-laws](/docs/policies/storage).)*
* If you have a key bond held by the Artifactory, we can either a) refund your bond, or b) retain your bond for later, as you instruct.
* **We look forwards to seeing you again when your circumstances permit!**

If you wish to **alter** your membership - e.g. change from monthly to annual payment, or to change your class of membership - please contact the treasurer (treasurer@artifactory.org.au).
