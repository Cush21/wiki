This is the [by-law](/docs/policies/bylaws) governing subcommittees.

By-laws are made by the committee, as allowed for rule 65 of the [Constitution](/constitution) regarding *By-laws*.

## Background (informative)

Subcommittees allow normal members (and even non-members) to participate in running the Artifactory.

A well run subcommittee ---

* Takes load off the management committee; and
* Allows the Artifactory to benefit from specialist experience; and
* Is open to scrutiny and observation by interested members (as is the management committee); and
* Is run in a friendly and collegial way.




## Objects of this by-law

This by-law extends the rules of the constitution regarding subcommittees, to provide a practical framework for starting, running, and disbanding subcommittees.



## Terms used

Unless the contrary intention appears, all terms are as defined as in the Constitution, and the following:

- "the Act" means the Associations Incorporation Act 2015 (WA).
- "Artifactory" means the Association.
- "Committee" means the management committee of the Association.
- "Committee member" means a member of the management committee.
- "Constitution" means the rules of the Association.



## Appointment of subcommittee

The committee may appoint a subcommittee as per rule 49 of the constitution.

The committee must define in writing ---

-  The name of the subcommittee.
-  The terms of reference of the subcommittee.
-  The powers or duties delegated to the subcommittee, subject to rule 50 of the constitution.
-  The people who will be the initial members of the subcommittee.



## Membership of subcommittee

A subcommittee ---

- must have at least two members.
- must include at least one committee member.
- may include any person the committee considers appropriate, whether the person is a member or not.

A person may be appointed to, or removed from, a subcommittee ---

- By the committee; or
- By the subcommittee, subject to approval by the committee.



## Operation

A member of a subcommitee may require any action of a subcommittee to be approved by a motion of the subcommittee.

A motion of a subcommittee is carried if a majority of the members of the subcommittee vote in favour of the motion.

A subcommittee may otherwise meet and conduct business in any way its members see fit, subject to ---

- The constitution and by-laws of the Association; and
- The terms of reference of the subcommittee; and
- The written delegation of powers or duties to the subcommittee.



## Record keeping

The subcommitee must maintain a public web page which records ---

- The name of the subcommittee.
- The terms of reference of the subcommittee, and the powers and duties currently delegated to the subcommittee.
- The full name of each member of the subcommittee.
- The contact details for the subcommittee.

The subcommittee must ensure that minutes are taken and kept of each meeting of the subcommittee. The minutes must be published on a public web page.

The subcommittee must make a record of ---

- Any change to the name, terms of reference, powers and duties delegated, or membership of the subcommittee.
- Any motion on which a vote is taken, and the result of the vote.

The subcommittee must provide the Association with the name and address of each person who is a member of the subcommittee, so that the Association can keep a record of office holders as required by Section 58(2) of the Act.

> Section 58(2) of the Act requires the Association to maintain a record of the names **and addresses** of the persons who "hold other offices of the association provided for by its rules", such as members of subcommittees.
> 
> The definition of **address** in the Act includes any of a residential, business, PO box, or email address.
> 
> Addresses should be stored in the Association's member management system (e.g. TidyHQ).

## Annual review

At the first committee meeting after each annual general meeting, the committee must consider each subcommittee, and determine -

- Whether the subcommittee meets the minimum requirements to continue operating; and
- If the subcommittee will continue or be disbanded.


## Disbanding

A subcommittee is disbanded when any of the following takes place ---

- There are less than two subcommitee members.
- The subcommittee does not include a committee member.
- The subcommittee reports to the committee that they have resolved to disband.
- The committee decides to disband the subcommittee ---
    - After the annual review; or
    - Because the subcommittee has exceeded its delegated authority; or
    - For any other reason.

All powers and duties delegated to a subcommittee are revoked when the subcommittee is disbanded.

# Guidance for subcommittees

> This will be a separate document to the by-law itself.
{.is-info}

* Within their area of responsibility, and if it is within their terms of reference, the sub-committee will be the appropriate place for normal members to:
  * Obtain permission/training to access/operate,
  * Request maintenance or obtain permission to maintain,
  * Request a modification or obtain permission to modify, and
  * Request updates on the current operational status.

* Any action taken by the subcommittee should be communicated to all members of the subcommittee.
  * Sub-committees are encouraged to nominate a secretary to be responsible for minuting and reporting.
  * Sub-committees should generally operate on a "plan" then "do" model which enables all members of the subcommittee to be aware of the plans before they are put into effect.
  * Membership of a sub-committee does not give individuals the freedom to act unilaterally. A sub-committee has been formed by the main committee to allow a team to work on a task.

* The subcommitee should maintain public documentation for all things within their terms of reference.

* The subcommittee should be ready and willing to report the current status of any action they are undertaking to:
  * Their own members.
  * A main committee member.
  * The main committee at each committee meeting.
