So you reckon this artifactory place sounds kinda cool, here's how we recommend getting involved.

## 1. Have a think about a project you might like to complete or an area you're interested in

This doesn't have to be super fleshed out, it just gives us a good starting point when you visit. If you've already found something that takes your fancy this step is done!

If you're really not sure we recommend picking an overall area for your first project and exploring resources on YouTube from there. Adding "beginner project" to the following areas may prove fruitful:

* Woodworking
* Metalworking
* Electronics
* CNC Routing
* Laser Cutting
* 3D Printing

These aren't all the areas the Artifactory has to offer but they're some great starting points.

## 2. Organise your first visit to the space

[This page](https://artifactory.org.au/first_visit) has some great resources on when your first visit should be and what you need to do beforehand.

## 3. Visit!

Come check out the workshop, chat with our volunteers, and see if the space is a good fit for you.

## 4. Decide whether you want to join

This is the first actual decision you need to make. You can either use the space as a casual attendee (Day Pass) or join our community as a member. Here are some of the key differences:

|                                                                       | Day Pass | Member |
| -                                                                     | -------- | ------ |
| Access to events                                                      | Y        | Y      |
| Training on our smaller tools                                         | Y        | Y      |
| Training on our more complex and larger tools                         | N        | Y      |
| Priority access for inductions and training                           | N        | Y      |
| Assistance with project planning                                      | N        | Y      |
| Onsite storage                                                        | N        | Y      |
| Apply for 24/7 access                                                 | N        | Y      |
| Reduced tool usage fees                                               | N        | Y      |
| The knowledge that you're supporting a community that supports makers | N        | Y      |

And a few things to keep in mind when deciding:

* Many areas of the space are set up with members as the priority.
* We are a community first. If you have a tight deadline and plan to smash out a single project then leave we may not be suitable. We will not adjust our induction or access policies based on your deadline.
* It's okay to start as a day pass user and then move over to a membership once you realise we're the right fit for you. 

## 5. Read the new member/visitor guide

* If you've decided to join us as a member read our [New Member Guide](/new_members_guide) - It's okay if some things don't make sense yet, we'll go over the contents of this document in your initial induction.
* If you want to start off with a Day Pass read our [New Visitor Guide](/new_visitors_guide)

## 6. Join Slack

If you haven't already now is the time to join Slack, our online communication platform. Everyone is welcome on Slack, it's not members only. We **strongly recommend** setting your name on Slack to the name you want to be referred to in person rather than an online/screen name. If you're comfortable doing so you should set a profile picture of yourself â€” this will help people put a face to your messages and kickstarts people recognising you in the workshop.

If you decided to sign up as a member an Artifactory logo should appear next to your name within an hour of you joining. Ask in #general if this hasn't happened after 24 hours.

## 7. Read our training/induction policy

[This doument](docs/policies/training) will give you a good idea of what tools need specific inductions.

We require a 1:1 time committment for training and inductions you receive in the space. This means that if a volunteer spends an hour helping you we expect you to spend *at least* an hour helping out around the space with things like communal cleaning.

> If you have a disability that should be considered during training or when meeting your corresponding volunteering obligations please reach out to our membership officer (Fletcher) to discuss. We will **always** work with you to ensure you are adequately supported.

## 8. Decide which tools you need for your project

We've found it's usually helpful to make a list of all the tools you're going to need to use to complete your project.

* Day pass users can get some limited advice by asking in the relevant Slack channel, if you're not sure which channel is appropriate just ask in #general.
* Members can get in depth answers using the same channels or by organising a time to sit down with one of our volunteers. Remember to check whether your name has an Artifactory logo next to it, this is how we know you're a member.

## 9. Book a new member induction (Members only)

Our new member induction goes into the nitty gritty of what it means to be a member of our community and is **mandatory for all members**. It is not the same as a tour of the space.

Take a look in #training-and-inductions for upcoming days where new member inductions are being offered. This will typically be Saturday during the day and alternate Wednesday/Monday evenings. If the post listing the day in question isn't in the channel yet please be patient.

Once you've found a time slot that suits reply to the message letting us know you'll be attending.

## 10. Book inductions on the tools you need for your project

Use the instructions from the previous step to book inductions on the tools you need.

## 11. Start attending events and working on your project

https://artifactory.org.au/events

Check our event calendar for upcoming events that suit your schedule. It's usually fine to work on projects not related to the event in question. (Woodworking can still be done during Metal Monday for example)

## 12. Work towards 24/7 access (Members only)

A key comes with a lot of trust attached. The best way to earn that trust is to demonstrate that you're a responsible member of our community. This can be done by:

* Attending events - Feel free to reach out to our membership officer (Fletcher) on Slack if you're a bit nervous getting started.
* Completing tool inductions - One of the best ways for us to get to know you is to see how you use tools close up.
* Helping out around the space - Finding things to do is typically covered in your new member induction, ask someone in the space next time you're in if this didn't happen. (In short, check the whiteboard) While you'll be doing some things already to meet your volunteer obligations when receiving training we always appreciate any extra time you're able to contribute.
* Working on projects in a safe and respectful manner.

Once you feel you've met our requirements (covered in the new member induction) reach out to membership@artifactory.org.au or a committee member in the space.

## 13. Get involved in running the Artifactory itself

* Help run an event - Post in #events-and-promotions if you have a new event idea.
* Contribute towards our fundraising efforts - From time to time we'll ask for help making things that will be used to fundraise for the space. Keep an eye out in #general or ask a committee member for upcoming opportunities
* Attend our laser maintenance nights - Keep an eye on #lasers for this event, it typically runs every 6 weeks.
* Get involved in an infrastructure build - Keep an eye out for volunteer callouts for larger projects in #general or ask a member of our Infrastructure team about things that need to be done. Sometimes we have projects that need an extra set of hands, sometimes we need people with particular skills. The infra folk will help direct you as appropriate.
* Become a tool trainer - Our standard for trainers is quite high, we will typically approach you if we think you'd be a good fit and we see you around the space frequently.
* Join one of our subcommittees - Membership of these groups are largely by invitation. We'll reach out if we think you're a good fit and see you around the space frequently.
