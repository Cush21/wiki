# Workshop Induction - DRAFT

## Purpose

This induction is mandatory for all new members of the space.

> Ed: casual day rate users?

New members must be inducted regarding:

* Expectations for behaviour in our space.
* Safety information, including which tools require specific training before use.
* Rules and bylaws which they are likely to encounter.

By following a set format for this induction, we will ensure that new members consistently recieve all the information they need to successfully participate in our community.

## How to deliver this induction

Start in the foyer and work your way clockwise around the space.

>Beau: Preference, can it be performed anti clockwise until the electronics lab is refurbished? This is the first impression of the space, and reflects poorly.

This induction should take about 30 minutes and can be performed with multiple people at a time.

**Completion of this induction must be recorded in TidyHQ.**
