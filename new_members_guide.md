# New Members Guide

Welcome to the Artifactory!

Please take a few minutes to read this New Members Guide to orientate yourself with our ways and practices.

## Official stuff

* [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct)
    * **Very important to read!** - Our expectations for how we treat each other, and how we treat the space.
    
* We're a fully volunteer organisation run by a [committee](/docs/committee/home).
    * You can contact the committee at any time via Slack or email - committee@artifactory.org.au.
    
* Please keep your personal details up-to-date in TidyHQ.
    * Your full name, email or address, and contact details - this is a legal requirement.
    * Emergency contact details.

* [Training](/docs/policies/training)
    * Training is needed to use many of the tools in the space.
    * **Please read the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy for more details.**

* [By-Laws](/docs/policies/bylaws)
    * Policies regarding what you can (and can't) do in the space, things you have to ask permission before doing, and various administrative matters.

* [Constitution](/constitution)
    * Defines your legal rights and responsibilities as a member.
    
* The Perth Artifactory [Emergency Plan is available for viewing here](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=events:artifactory_emergency_plan_-_june_2019.png) in addition to those displayed in every single room of the Artifactory. It shows the location of the first aid kits, Fire extinguishers/hose, switchboard, muster point and escape route.

* Reporting injuries (or near misses) helps us keep everyone safe. Use [this form](https://cloud.artifactory.org.au/apps/forms/62rTWpZH4fr5di2H) to document the details while they're fresh in your mind.

## The Space is Communal

We are designated as a factory space.

* Ensure access areas are kept clean, tools are safe.
* Ensure that your clothing is appropriate.
* Refer [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) regarding *Safe Use of Tools*.

Keep it nice for everyone else:

* **Leave the space cleaner than you found it.**
* Pick up your rubbish.
* Put away everything you used.
* Clean the area you worked in - wipe, sweep, vacuum.
* Help with the communal cleaning - empty the bins, do a bit of sweeping and vacuuming, do a bit of sorting...
* Do not use power wood cutting tools inside, nor spray paints - the dust can affect electronics, furniture, and other member's breathing. Try to avoid use of resins or other volatiles inside as well. The exception here is locations specifically designated for this purpose.
* Refer [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) regarding *Respectful Behaviour*.

## Storage Space

Anything you want to keep must be in your storage space.

* [Individual member storage space](/docs/policies/storage#individual-member-storage-spaces)
* [Sheet material racks](/docs/policies/storage#sheet-material-racks)
* [Workspace Usage](/docs/policies/storage#workspace-usage)
* Full terms and conditions: [Storage](/docs/policies/storage).

Anything which is left in the space un-labelled will be either treated as [lost and found](/docs/policies/storage#lost-and-found) or  [disposed of](/docs/policies/storage#disposal-of-property).

## Access to the space

As a new member, your access to the space will initially be limited to the [events on our calendar](https://artifactory.org.au/events).

You may also be able to arrange with a key-holding member to attend the space with you, but there's no guarantee that a member will be available at any particular time.

Refer: [Artifactory Access](/docs/committee/artifactory_access)

## 24/7 Access

Members who meet our requirements may apply for a 24/7 key (RFID key) after an initial probation period.

Details:
* [RFID keys for Members](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/bylaws#rfid-keys-for-members)
* [Keyholder Responsibilities](/docs/policies/keyholder_responsibilities)

## Heavy Tool Use                 

* See: [Training](/docs/policies/training)
* Heavy tools will be pointed out to you during your initial tour. We recommend using Slack (see below) to organise training.
* No one can use Heavy Tools unless they have been inducted by an existing certified member. If you're not familiar with their safe operation, you could kill yourself, REALLY.
* A list of certified users for some tools are available in the tools section of this wiki.
* Make sure you know where the First Aid Kit is, currently in the kitchen.
* ALWAYS use safety gear - goggles, earplugs, masks as documented on their respective tool pages.
* Preferably only use Heavy Tools when someone else is in the building in case of serious accidents.

## Communal Materials

* Crafting materials
  * Laser scrap rack
  * Upcycle rack
  * Hack rack
* Cleaning products: kitchen
* Spray paint: filing cabinet in the back shed - unless labelled with someone's name.
* Otherwise **check** with another member before you start using supplies. Many supplies belong to individual members.
* If you find you are using a lot of a communal supply like superglue, turpentine, masking tape, wood screws, etc, you should **buy more** for the Artifactory.

## Communications

[Slack](https://perart.io/slack) is the number one point of contact for anything and everything Artifactory.

* If you would like to be **trained on a certain machine,** **reporting a fault** with the equipment or even need **input and advice** for your current project there will usually be a specific channel for your question. If you're not sure ask in #general.
