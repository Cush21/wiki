# Tools
The Perth Artifactory has a huge range of tools available for your use in a wide variety of disciplines. Tools range from a simple hammer to a Laser Cutter and Metal Lathe. 

Some tools carry a significant risk of injury if used incorrectly (lost fingers or death), so you MUST check out the [Training Guide](/docs/policies/training) ***before*** you start to use any of the tools. Many of the tools also require an induction prior to use for your safety and to ensure the tools remain operational for all. 

You can also review which tools you are approved to use with the [Training Tracker on Slack](https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/D06Q10XUCSE).

Some tools have a [small fee](/docs/policies/fees) for use to offset the tool operating costs. Members of Artifactory get discounted rates, so it's another great [reason to join](https://artifactory.org.au/pricing).
 
We get it! We can't wait to dive into a project either, but even if you've used a tool before, it's a great idea to check out the guide for each specific tool. Don't forget, like most things at Artifactory, be reasonable. Tools are shared resources, so consider your fellow members if you are going to use it for a long time. Tools must be kept on site and in the event that something breaks (even if you accidentally broke it), please let one of the admins know so it can be repaired.

Most of all, be safe, have fun and share when you build something amazing!

## Design Lab
The design lab is generally used for work design work that requires a computer. Examples include:
* Designing items in modelling software such as Fusion360
* Slicing files for 3D Printing

- *Computer Placeholders*
- *Computer Placeholders*


## Rehearsal Room
Planning on becoming the next AC/DC? They didn't just drink all day and smash out the concert. They rehearsed too (I guess?). You too can rehearse for a [low fee per session](/docs/policies/fees) or for free if you have a [Band Membership](/docs/policies/classes_of_membership)!

## 3D Printing & Electronics Lab
Want to dream something, wait a couple of hours and then see your creation magically appear? 3D Printing is your answer!
Then for bonus points, add some electronic wizardry - all possible in the 3D printing and Electronics Lab.
