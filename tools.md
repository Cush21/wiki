# Tools
The Perth Artifactory has a huge range of tools available for your use in a wide variety of disciplines. Tools range from a simple hammer to a Laser Cutter and Metal Lathe. 

Some tools carry a significant risk of injury if used incorrectly (permanent disability or death), so you MUST check out the [Training Policy](/docs/policies/training) ***before*** you start to use any of the tools. Most of the tools require an induction prior to use for your safety and to ensure the tools remain operational for all. You can also review which tools you are approved to use with the [Training Tracker on Slack](https://perart.io/check_training).

Some tools have a [small fee](/docs/policies/fees) for use to offset the tool operating costs. Members of Artifactory get discounted rates, so it's another great [reason to join](https://artifactory.org.au/pricing).
 
We get it! We can't wait to dive into a project either, but even if you've used a tool before, it's a great idea to check out the guide for each specific tool. Don't forget, like most things at Artifactory, be reasonable. Tools are shared resources, so consider your fellow members if you are going to use it for a long time. Tools must be kept on site and in the event that something breaks (even if you accidentally broke it), please let one of the admins know so it can be repaired.

Most of all, be safe, have fun and share when you build something amazing!

## Legend for Tool List
| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
|**Risk:** | Tools are graded as per the [Training Policy](/docs/policies/training). You must be trained on Yellow or Red tools prior to use.
|**Tool Name:** | This is what we call the tool. You can call it by a pet name if you so desire whilst using it.
|**Artifactory Policy:** | The Clipboard icon (üìã) will take you to the specific Artifactory guide for that tool. It's generally the most important link.  
| | The dollar icon (üíµ) indicates that the tool has a charge for use. Click the note to find out the cost for use. 
| | The broken face icon (üòµ) indicates that the tool is currently out of order/broken. 
|**Model & OEM Info:** |The link icon (üîó) will take you to the manufacturers webpage. 
| | The (üìñ) icon will take you to the manufacturers operations manual.
|**Looks Like:**| Perhaps unsurprisingly, this will show you what the tool looks like.
|**Usual Location:**| This is where the tool is normally located. It may not always be here, but it's a good place to start your search.
|**Owned by:**| The :gift: icon indicates that this tool has been generously loaned by a member. Otherwise it is owned by the Artifactory where the AF Logo exists.

## Rehearsal Room
Planning on becoming the next AC/DC? They didn't just drink all day and smash out the concert. They rehearsed too (I guess?). You too can rehearse for a [low fee per session](/docs/policies/fees) or for free if you have a [Band Membership](/docs/policies/classes_of_membership)!
