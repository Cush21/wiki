#### Wine & Design

An evening of contemplating artifact and interior Design - partly with the aim of making the Space look cool, partly to develop an Artifactory Aesthetic.

A great evening to come down to see the space for the first time, or get involved with upgrading the space.

Organizer: Perth Artifactory
