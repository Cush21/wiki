### Empty the Skip

-   When the skip bin is full, any member can call [Instant Waste Management](http://www.instantwaste.com.au/contact-us/): 08 9379 2111
-   Their office is open 0700-1700 Mon-Fri, 0700-1200 Sat
-   Say you're from the 'Perth Artifactory'. They'll probably ask if it is a “skip is front loading with a lid” - Say “YES” and they may confirm address. 8 / 16 Guthrie St, Osborne Park.
-   Place the sign “LEAVE GATE OPEN FOR SKIP EMPTY” on gate, which lives in the Artifactory foyer.
-   Leave carpark gate wide open for the truck
-   We are charged approximately \$61 an empty in 2018
-   Bulk metal is heavy and valuable - expensive in the skip, potentially profitable (or at least picked up for free) outside it.
