This document is intended to cover loans of tools by members (“tool owner”) to The Artifactory. An agreement made using this document must be approved by at least two members of the Artifactory Executive and the Infrastructure Subcommittee. Sections of this document may be striked out by an agreement of all parties.

## Space protection

* Perth Artifactory Inc is not financially responsible for damages to loaned equipment. 
  * The association will endeavour to identify who caused damage to the tool. 
  * The Artifactory will attempt to investigate and correct any systematic causes for damage to the tool.
  * The management committee may opt to hold members financially responsible for damages where it is determined that the damage was negligence on the part of the member.
    * This determination will be made by the Management Committee assisted by the Infrastructure Subcommittee.
* The Artifactory is not responsible for maintenance costs associated with the machine.
* The Artifactory may request that the tool be removed from the space at any time.
  * The management committee must give the tool owner reasonable notice that reflects the difficulty of relocating the tool. The notice does not need to reflect the tool owner’s alternative storage options.
* The Artifactory may opt to implement a tool usage fee for the tool to reflect power usage, workshop usage, and other costs determined by the management committee.
* The Artifactory Infrastructure Subcommittee may opt to gate a loaned tool behind a safety induction.
  * In the event that a safety induction is in place the tool owner does not automatically have the ability to induct users.

## Owner protection

* The tool owner may request to take the tool back by providing written notice to the management committee.
* The Perth Artifactory will assume fault in place of the tool owner if a user is injured using the machine. 
  * This provision is applicable to the extent that the event is covered under any applicable insurance policy held by Perth Artifactory Inc.
* In the event that the tool is damaged in a manner that is covered by an insurance policy held by Perth Artifactory Inc the association shall be responsible for the policy excess.
