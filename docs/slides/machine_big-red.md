# What to expect from this training {data-background-image="https://artifactory.org.au/assets/site/gallery/20181123_002935.jpg"}

* Training is run over 2 sessions: A practical training session and an assessment conducted on a different day
* Make use of all the resources we provide you. (Checklist, operation guides etc)

# Test?

## Turn the machine on at the wall
::: incremental

* Check the water chiller <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Check the fume extraction <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::

## Chiller

Brrr

## Extractor

Vrrrr

::: notes

* Most people don't know what an industrial chiller looks like, point it out and explain why it's important.
* Since the primary sound generated by the extractor is in the next room it's difficult to determine by sound alone whether the extractor is connected, hence the encouragement to physically check. For a variety of reasons warn the trainee that there's going to be a residue on the slots before they touch them.

The workshop only works if people are held accountable for leaving the workshop a mess.
