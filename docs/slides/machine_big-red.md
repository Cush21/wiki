# Turn the machine on at the wall

## Water Chiller

It's the white box to the left of the laser cutter. You can tell that it's on because the green light will be on. Don't worry about the temperature just yet.
::: notes
Most people don't know what an industrial chiller looks like, point it out and explain why it's important.
:::

## Fume Extractor

Big Red uses a large air extractor that is connected to the back of the machine. Fumes are pulled out of the machine through slots located inside the cutting bay behind the bed. Put your hand over these slots and check for slight air movement.

::: notes
Since the primary sound generated by the extractor is in the next room it's difficult to determine by sound alone whether the extractor is connected, hence the encouragement to physically check. For a variety of reasons warn the trainee that there's going to be a residue on the slots before they touch them.

# Workshop reports

The workshop only works if people are held accountable for leaving the workshop a mess.
