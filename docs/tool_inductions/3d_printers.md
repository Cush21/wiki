Printer may notice - or it might not!!

Explain multiple filaments in Bambu Studio.
Sync from printer.

Explain presets.
Layer heights, strength, normal, draft.

Explain various adjustment settings.
* Layer height - 0.2 initial, adjust subsequent layer heights as wanted. No less than 0.10mm (risk of clogging). 0.12mm generally minimum recommended. Printing at less than 0.10mm will result in loss of printing privileges.
* Line width - don't adjust.
* Wall loops - afffects strength - by experimentation and experience.
* Infill - affects strength - by experimentation and experience.
* Top and bottom shells - leave at default.

Support.
* Explain why support needed.
* Overhang angles, bridge distances.
* Part orientation.
* Demo use axlotl.
  * Auto support.
  * Manual painted support. Left to paint support enforcement, right to paint support blocker.



Payment.
Explain filament tiers.
Explain payment process.
Emphasise bank transfer, no EFTPOS.
