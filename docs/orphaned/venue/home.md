# Artifactory Space Management

## Events & Large Project Space

Parts We Require:

1.  Speakers
    1.  2 x JBL MRX515 - \$1,029 each.
2.  Amplifier
    1.  Crown Drive Core XLS 2000, \$999.95
3.  Projector
    1.  Proper Conference Projector - Panasonic PT-DZ6700E, \$20,281.79

    -   SKoT says: absolute overkill, no chance of getting, if we got a grant that size, there's about 10 other things we could get for teh same money.
    -   Brendan Says: This is included as a benchmark and if we want to pad the budget. It's actually the cheapest 3K Lumen or greater 1080p projector I can find (though the price is more along the lines of RRP and \*not\* what it would cost us), If there's something \> 3K Lumen and 1080P (or even 720P) i'll stick that in instead. If there are other things that are Social Space related that we should be spending the money on - add them in.

    1.  Hi Def Projector - Epson EH-TW3500, \$2,499 - SKoT says: I have something similar, is fine, prob still overkill. multiple cheaper ones would be of more use and more fun.
    2.  Bright Conference Projector - Mitsubishi XD600U, \$3,200

       * SKoT says: overkill. 
       * Brendan Says: Not really. Not if you want to have the lights on in the space and actually see anything. 
    - DJ Mixer
      - Allen & Heath Xone DB4 ($3,999) 
       * SKoT says: overkill. Don't think it is the Artifactory's place to provide decent studio gear. Something more knock-around will be much better, and it is prob something that should be a group buy of those interested in learning DJing.
       * Brendan Says: Absolutely, this is there as a "maximum price this thing should cost", and also if we decide we need to pad the application. 
    - Microphone
      - Wired - Shure SM58S - $239.00
      - Wireless - JTS US8001D belt mic - $170
      - Wireless - JTS US8001D receiver - $300
    - Cameras
      - SKoT: Panasonic HDC-SD900 is 14.2 mega pix, 3D capable, HD - $2000 or so. 
      - SKoT: Suggest a couple of knock-around $300 cameras a better idea, as multiple angles would be of more use than hidef, and it will all be shrunk down for youtube anyway.
    - Recording Apparatus
      - SKoT: computer with a ~$200 USB sound card will be fine. May need mic preamp. Some music SC have built in preamps.
      - SKoT: Mic cables - make our own. Cables are skank-tastic, price wise.
      - SKoT: Mic stands
