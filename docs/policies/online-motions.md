# Asynchronous online-only motions

## Object

To define a way for the committee to raise and vote on motions outside of committee meetings.

This will allow the committee to - 

- Efficiently deal with routine business, and
- Make quick decisions when dealing with urgent business.

## Online platform

A committee member may raise an *online motion* for consideration by the committee via an *online platform* administered by the Association.

The *online platform* used for this purpose must -
- Be approved by the chairperson of the Association; and
- Allow all committee members to raise, view, and vote on motions; and
- Send an email notice to each committee member's Artifactory-provided email address when a new motion is raised; and
- Must keep a record of how each committee member voted on each motion, i.e. voting must not be anonymous.

## Raising and participating in online motions

Any committee member may raise an online motion.

All online motions must be open for at least 72 hours.

While an online motion is open, a committee member may participate in the vote by:
- Voting "aye"; or
- Voting "nay"; or
- Recording that they wish to abstain from this particular motion; or
- Vetoing the motion.

## Closing and determining the results of online motions

An online motion closes as soon as one of the following events occurs -

| Event | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| All committee members have participated in the vote. | If there were no "nay" votes, the motion passes. Otherwise, the motion fails. |
| The committee member who raised the motion decides to withdraw it. | The motion lapses. |
| Any committee member vetoes the motion. | The motion fails. At least 72 hours must pass before the matter can be considered as part of another online motion. |
| A scheduled committee meeting starts. | All outstanding online motions lapse. |
| The voting period expires. | If at least two-thirds of the commitee members (rounded up) have participated in the vote, and there were no "nay" votes, the motion passes. Otherwise, the motion fails. |

## Recording the results of online motions

The details of each *online motion* must be recorded in the minutes of the next committee meeting. The details recorded must include:
- The full text of the *online motion*; and
- The result of the *online motion*, e.g. passed, failed, lapsed, or withdrawn.

## History

The first version of this by-law regarding asynchronous online motions was adopted [2022-04-09](/minutes/Committee/2022-04-09).

The by-law was re-drafted in July 2023 and adopted at the committee meeting of [2023-07-22](/minutes/Committee/2023-07-22).

The main changes were:
- Add a requirement that all committee members must recieve written notice when a motion is raised.
- Allow votes to close after 72 hours, and define what happens when some committee members have not voted.
- Separate the concepts of a veto (immediately ends the vote) vs. voting "nay".
- Clarify when motions lapse relative to a scheduled committee meeting. ("convened" vs "starts")
