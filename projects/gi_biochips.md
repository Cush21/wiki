In the classic 2000AD story, "Rogue Trooper", our hero in the "Battlefield of Tomorrow" is accompanied by 3 dead companions, their personalities and cell lines captured in in "BioChips" allowing them to assist and control the devices their chips are plugged into.  
Currently I have modelled the basic 3 weapons Rogue carried, Helm, Bagman and Gunnar.
