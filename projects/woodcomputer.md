# Wood Computer

*Something that computes*

Something that I wanted to build anyway, but modified to be based on one from [woodgears.ca](http://woodgears.ca/marbleadd/index.html)

I wanted mine to be modular to allow arbitrary precision. The initial aim is to build a rig that is able to demonstrate simple binary operations like increments and binary addition.
