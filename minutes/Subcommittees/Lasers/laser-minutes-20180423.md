# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2018-04-23

Attendees: Nick, Blake

Issues:

-   Big red x axis belt had broken (as reported on mailing list)
    -   Used spare belt to replace machine
-   Updated spares list on wiki
-   Hour meter on big red at 149hours
-   Cleaned big red tracks
-   Cleaned big red lens and reattached head
-   Test cuts getting 55 to 60mm/s on 3mm MDF
-   z-probe in centre and cuts in corners gave variable cut speeds. z-probing each corner worked well though. heights using acrylic ruler thing were within 1mm so not totally sure what the issue is. had previously checked beam alignment and was ok.
