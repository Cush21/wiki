# 2023-07-26 Laser Maintenance

Present:
* Blake Samuels
* Bruce Chambers
* Nick Bannon
* Alice
* Ross
* Lewis Yip

### Chiller inspection
* Lewis brought an endoscope camera, also some in electronics lab
  * Check chillers for algal buildup: Lewis, Ross, Nick
  * No visible algae in CW-5200 chiller connected to the LC1290
  * No visible algae in CW-5000 chiller connected to the KH7090 - UV steriliser attached

### LC1290 "Big red"
* Blake, Bruce: lens clean, align
  * Troubleshooting: Blake, Bruce, Nick, Alice, Fletcher: Beam does not appear straight as bed raises/lowers
    * Red laser aiming spot walks slowly to the left X as the bed lowers
    * Also checked with large clear acrylic block (deep multi-second test fire)
    * OK without the lens, try replacing O-ring
    * Cause: Final mirror was backed off to have more adjustable dynamic range
      * which moved the beam centre off the lens centre
      * Fix: Mirror lowered back to near-flush position    
  * Cutting 3mm MDF at 35-45mm/sec in all corners, slightly worse at top left
    * 28-29mA current
