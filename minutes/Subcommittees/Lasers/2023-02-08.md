Backfilled minutes (none taken at maint session)

Attendees:
* Blake Samuels
* Bruce Chambers
* John Parker

Notes:
* Middle red lens locking ring - threads are flogged out - not an operational issue as lens is secured by other parts when in use. Mainly a maintenance issue.
* Middle red lens cleaned.
* Blake showed Bruce how to clean mirrors. Bruce cleaned one of the mirrors.
* John attempted repair of frame on Big Red's honeycomb. Didn't have long enough rivets. Obtained rivets and fixed after the session.
