Another positive month for the space, with strong membership payments and improved timely payment from members.
A number of big tool purchases during the month funded by member donations: 3D Scanner, Wood Bandsaw, Track Saw and Soldering Station.
Significant income from SupaNova - Over $4,000.
Higher than usual power bill - likely from 3D printing for Supanova as well as increased per unit costs.
