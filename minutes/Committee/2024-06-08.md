## Treasurer's Report

Membership Income for the month is down $1,000 from average. It does historically vary significantly month to month due to billing due dates being on the last day of the month, and members who do not pay regularly. Worth monitoring to ensure it is just an outlier as expected.

Amount in Sponsored student membership accounts includes other funds.
