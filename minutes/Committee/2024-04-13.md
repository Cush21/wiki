| Account                       | Balance     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Operations                    | $6,768      |
| Donations                     | $20,000     |
| Sponsored Student Memberships | $2,395      |
| Sale Program                  | $0          |
| TOTAL                         | $29,163.55  |

We have received two significant anonymous donations during the month, totalling $20,000. $10,000  will be used for contingency  funds while we implement changes to move the space back to a profitable (sustainable) position. The other $10,000 has been offered to match other donations to an infrastructure improvement fund. Further discussion on this in other business. Thank you to those involved in reaching out to your networks. 
Conversion of a few members to annual memberships will time extra income to March each year when our insurance comes due. Obviously there will be a corresponding drop in monthly income for the remainder of the year, but so far we are looking okay for the next few months without dipping into the major donations. 


### Expenses for Approval

* $100|$170 for curtains to cover pallet racks during some events.
  * Cost is either $46/rack if using two per rack or $84 for wider. (latter would look neater but may be harder for a single person to put up)

### Worksafe Inspection 

We had a worksafe inspector attend the space in response to a complaint they received about our welding bay being messy
The inspector was happy with the space and our processes
It highlights the importance of having every person sign up as a visitor and accept the waiver before they are involved with any of our activities, or use our tools. This includes anyone supporting a person in the space.
We also need to include in our basic induction that people have a responsibility to report any safety concerns or tool damage to us immediately 

### Infrastructure Improvements Donation Matching

We have had an anonymous person offer to match donations to an infrastructure improvement fund up to a maximum of $10,000. 
Use of funds to be directed by committee as usual, funds already received to allow an immediate start.
Requested inclusions include a revamp of the kitchen area, and works to improve the overall look of the space to make it more inviting to a wider range of people.
Suggest setting up a web page specifically for this campaign

### Commercial Woodworking Workshops

Looomio thread: https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/X0reqcbB/proposal-for-short-course-women-s-woodworking-

Renae and Penny have made a proposal to trial a short 4 week "Make a Bookshelf" course to run on Tuesday nights starting 16 May.
It is designed as a profit-making effort for the Artifactory, but includes a proposal for instructors to be paid for their time.

### Front Door Security

Loomio thread: https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/9CmnsljW/update-to-keyholder-responsibilities-document-

There have been recent issues where the front door has been latched open and left unmonitored. 
An announcement was sent out on Slack, but we need to amend our keyholder responsibilities document to clarify additional rules around this.
Discussion in Slack infrastructure channel has discussed options for door sensors to help with compliance
