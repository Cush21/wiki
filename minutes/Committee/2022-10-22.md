## Event/Workshop Coordinator Reports

News and discussions on events.

### Tech

* Arduino U - (Coordinators: Blake, Stewart) - Event turnout has been good. We've also seen an uptick in new attendees. (Fletcher)
* Open Source Hackers / Perth Linux Users Group (Coordinators: Stephen Price*, Nick, Damon) - One instance of the event was scheduled but did not have a host. JC ended up having to ask the sole attendee to leave when he did. (Fletcher)

### Social

* Artifrag (Coordinator: Fletcher) - Solid turnout (11?), next one scheduled for next month.
* Wine & Design (Coordinator: Committee, Damon) - Quiet

### Cosplay and Craft

* Leathercraft Workshops (Coordinator: Andrew L aka Western Leathercraft*) - Andrew reported damage to a workbench (by an unknown person not associated with the event). Somewhat repaired (Fletcher)

### Music

* DIY Synth (Coordinator: Nathan Thompson, Andrew nonlinearcircuits*) - Ran, no issues reported
* Mostly Modular Synth (Coordinators: Hugh, Jon*) - Did not run
* Noizemaschin!! (Coordinators: Stuart*, Tim*, Skot, Stewbags*) - Did not run

### General

* General Hacking Day (Coordinator: Committee) - Turnout varies week to week, more volunteers would be nice. (Fletcher)
* Open Day (Coordinator: Fletcher) - Unpredictably busy/quiet, more volunteers would be nice. (Fletcher) 
* Metal Monday (Coordinator: Ben) -

### Other

(new and once off events)

* EVENT NAME (COORDINATOR) - REPORT

## Other Business

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.

### Curtin Robotics Club (CRoC)

Fletcher has met with reps from CRoC at Curtin and the workshop. General consensus is CRoC would be open to sponsorship opportunities that involve us running occasional workshops, hosting occasional events, and providing some level of sponsored memberships as competition prizes. In exchange we get a significant increase in awareness at Curtin + potential source for new members. They're coming up to their exam period and their committee changes over with the calendar year so further discussions and ironing out specific details are on hold for the moment.

Would be helpful if we delegated authority to come to an agreement with CRoC to a couple of committee members so that final discussions can take place. (within reason) Will suggest the same to them.
