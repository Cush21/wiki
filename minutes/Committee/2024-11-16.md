## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

While we are showing a monthly loss of $4,500, this was expected. This is a combination of the annual adjustment of our variable outgoings ($2,000), the deposit for the shadesails (Infrastructure Funds amount collected in previous months), and tool purchases (where funds were collected in August)

We are going to need to budget for an increase in our lease. Discussions ongoing at this point. While an increase is wholly reasonably, I am mindful that we were close to being insolvent around 6 months ago. I think it would be worthwhile to document all initiatived implemented in this time, to help us be aware of what has changed for us, and to measure the security of our financial position. The major risk is that we have a high proportion of inactive memberships where their future payments are not guaranteed.

In the short term: strong membership numbers, timely payments and effective follow up of unpaid invoices have put us in a good position.
