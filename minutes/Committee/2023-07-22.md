## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* Laser training costs for casual attendees has reduced the demand for laser training. Too soon to tell if this is a good thing but I suspect we've merely removed the people that didn't intend to stick around anyway.
* Potential fault with Big Red's controller, laser maintianers will likely investigate next week.
  * Upgrade/replacement likely $500 (same controller as Middle Red)
  * Little Red's controller isn't a viable option unless Big Red's is actually dead, has its own issues.

### IT Subcommittee

* Loomio trial in progress, see other business
* Three touch screen eboards donated to the space, one has been mounted in the foyer. We may be getting two slightly larger ones so holding off on mounting the other two until we know more since it affects placement. Proposed locations (not ordered based on priority:
  * ~~Foyer~~ - For pictures
  * Design Lab - For meetings
  * Over Big Red - To cast to when watching the laser
  * Project area trolley - For classes
  * Social area - For social events/winding down
* Teleport now has GPT support
* Last of the kinks are being worked out with the storage auth system. Should be ready for unabashed public consumption soon
* Network switch above the design lab has died, short term replacement is in place but isn't very power efficient (old and oversized)
  * This switch is pretty vital for the space to function
  * Project camera is back online

  * Working reach (at least for Fletcher) up to 3.9m

  * Check shed is locked
  * Check back door is locked
  * Check back roller door is down
  * Check that front roller door is locked
  * Check that welding bay is off
  * Press "Leaving" on the kiosk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other Business

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.

### Loomio trial

We have an opportunity to change how we make decisions. The current process is either discussions are had ad hoc in #committee, raised as motions in #committee-important or raised at a committee meeting. While this is an easy process for committee members to participate in it's somewhat difficult to administer and has an upper limit on votes.

The way I see it we have a few requirements for deliberation and decision making:

#### Onboarding

* Current system: Does not require any specific onboarding beyond Slack
* Loomio: Participants can sign in with their AF Google account (can be expanded to any google account later)

#### Usability

It needs to understandable and usable by people without a high degree of technical skill

* Current system: Relatively easy to understand what you need to do in order to vote. Slight barrier to understanding how to raise motions. Difficult to see at a glance if there's anything you've missed.
* Loomio: Seems to all be a pretty clean UI? How has everyone else found it so far?

Issues:

* <potential issue 1>
  * <solution?>

#### Committee handover/Institutional knowledge survivability

* Current system: Search minutes for minuted decision, navigate to slack channels to find discussion surrounding it if not present in minutes
* Loomio: Search loomio for decision. or Search minutes for decision, click on link to loomio discussion

#### Administrative burden

Whatever system we use should reduce the administrative burden placed on volunteers where possible

* Current system: Cannot be easily automated since we don't control the voting bot within slack
* Loomio: Has an API, some types of votes could be automatically started. Unsure as to whether we can automate the addition of information to discussions. Automatic vote closing is a feature.

#### Financial viability

* Current system: Free, limited to 100 (?) votes per month. We ran into this limit last month with the application catchup
* Loomio: Self hosted either:
  * locally - negligible cost, potentially $5/mo if I can't get certain things working
  * on Azure - silly expensive if we were paying for the credits but Microsoft is giving us those for free.
  * Loomio managed - $10/mo An option if all of our IT people get hit by a bus. Export file from self hosted instance, send file to Loomio, continue business as usual.

### Commercial waste disposal provider

Instant waste has upped their price to $83.60/pickup
City of Stirling quoted $85/pickup, minimum one pickup per month

We typically do 1-2 pickups per month.

Instant Waste:

* ✅ Bookings are entirely ad hoc and suit our sporadic use case
* ✅ Now has online bookings
* ❌ The wheels on the bin are fucked (skip isn't movable) and Instant Waste have previously shown zero inclination to fix the issue when reported.

CoS:

* ✅ Potentially more stable pricing since local government?
* ✅ Prices locked in for 12 months minimum (no contract)
* ❌ System seems to work on a "set frequency of pickup and alter by talking to staff as needed" rather than bookings
* ❌ No idea if we can get the same rate with Instant Waste again if we decide to swap back

Thoughts? (Motion text has been provided for convenience, I don't know either way)
