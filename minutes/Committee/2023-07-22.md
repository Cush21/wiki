## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* Laser training costs for casual attendees has reduced the demand for laser training. Too soon to tell if this is a good thing but I suspect we've merely removed the people that didn't intend to stick around anyway.
* Potential fault with Big Red's controller, laser maintianers will likely investigate next week.
  * Upgrade/replacement likely $500 (same controller as Middle Red)
  * Little Red's controller isn't a viable option unless Big Red's is actually dead, has its own issues.

### IT Subcommittee

* Loomio trial in progress, see other business
* Three touch screen eboards donated to the space, one has been mounted in the foyer. We may be getting two slightly larger ones so holding off on mounting the other two until we know more since it affects placement. Proposed locations (not ordered based on priority:
  * ~~Foyer~~ - For pictures
  * Design Lab - For meetings
  * Over Big Red - To cast to when watching the laser
  * Project area trolley - For classes
  * Social area - For social events/winding down
* Teleport now has GPT support
* Last of the kinks are being worked out with the storage auth system. Should be ready for unabashed public consumption soon
* Network switch above the design lab has died, short term replacement is in place but isn't very power efficient (old and oversized)
