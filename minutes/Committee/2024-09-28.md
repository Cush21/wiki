## Chairperson's Report

- Following the AGM meeting, feedback from members was overall positive, though there was a request for more transparency on how committee decisions are made.
- It was good to meet new members over the following week and observe how training and inductions impacted them.
- New members have been cautious when using yellow/red tools, often asking for a second opinion or supervision.
- It’s great to see members refer others to the Artifactory, as seen from random visitors after the AGM on Saturday. Thank you to those who help spread the word.

### Fridge + Vending Machine

Discussion on programming and stock allocation.

### Loomio

From JC:

- Management committee polls and sense checks : feasibility to make public to members, after decisions are finalised.

- Set specific dates/times for committee decisions and polls (e.g., expense approvals on specific days) to ensure all members know when to check. This is in contrast to alerts, which may come at inconvenient times.

### Code of conduct report

See original report and discussion in [Loomio](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/J61DSWpu/code-of-conduct-report-rami-nakamura-by-sophie-murday) (confidential - committee only).

Decision required on issuing a RFID key to one of the involved people, whether deferred to review at a later time, or refused.
