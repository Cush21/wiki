The proposed terms of reference include:

The remaining terms of reference are as per the existing Lasers subcommittee:

* Make recommendations to the main committee on all aspects of 3D printer maintenance, operation, upgrading, training and charging.
* Appoint 3D printer trainers as required.
* Determine training requirements as required.
* Scheduling operational and preventative maintenance.
* Organising the ordering and installation of replacement parts within a budget determined by the main committee.
