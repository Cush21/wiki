### Special Resolutions

> 51.4. Any other business of which notice has been given in accordance with these rules may be conducted at the annual general meeting.

#### Amendment to subrule 9.1 of the constitution

**Explanation of proposed subrule 9.1.f**

The existing subrule 9.1 lists five ways in which memberships end. 

Most memberships end when the member resigns or stops paying the membership fees. However  sponsored members never had any fees to pay, so their memberships technically never ended unless they resigned. 

The proposed subrule 9.1.f. explicitly provides for free and sponsored memberships to end after a fixed term, as intended. 


| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Alter subrule 9.1 of the constitution to insert a new clause 9.1.f, reading: *"9.1.f. for a member who has been granted free or sponsored membership of the Association for a specific period - as soon as that period expires, unless the member has applied to continue their membership, and the committee has accepted that application, and the member has paid any membership fees payable to the Association under rule 12."* | XXX       | XXX          | Accepted/Rejected |

### End of meeting

Meeting concluded at XX:XX hrs.
